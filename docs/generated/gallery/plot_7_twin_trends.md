TwinY Trends `twin_trends`
=================================
> Wafer Trend Charts by Flash Field with Dual Y-axis

Have the advantage of double Y-axis, we're able to put two very different variables into same subplot for comparison. Take below chart for example, there's ~200ohm gap between `MR` &  `MRR`, yet two variables have similar sigma. You can find that `MR` basically overlaps with  `MRR`, the correlation between `MR` &  `MRR could be easily deduced from this chart.

```{.python }

from wfmap.data import load_data
from wfmap import twin_trends
import scipy.stats.distributions as dist

data = load_data().query('80<MR<180')
norm = dist.norm_gen()
data['MRR'] = 200 + data['MR'] + \
    norm.rvs(data['MR'].median(), data['MR'].std(), size=len(data['MR']))

fig = twin_trends(data, 'MR', 'MRR')

```{.python }

# When two variables not only have very different mean, the sigma is also not at the same level. The scale could no longer keep the same for Y & 2nd-Y axis, then need to adjust it as `fix_scale=False`.

fig2 = twin_trends(data, 'MR', 'HDI', fix_scale=False)
```
