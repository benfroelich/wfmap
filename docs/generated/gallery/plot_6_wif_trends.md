WIF Trends
=================================
> Wafer Trend Charts by Flash Field For Multiple Variables within Similar Range

This example demonstrates how to import a local module and how images are
stacked when two plots are created in one code block. The variable ``N`` from
the example 'Local module' (file ``local_module.py``) is imported in the code
below. Further, note that when there is only one code block in an example, the
output appears before the code block.
