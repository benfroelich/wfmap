IncomingMap 
=================================
> Combined WaferMap for Wafer Incoming Data

IncomingMap is an horizontal concatenation of multiple WaferMap for wafer incoming data. `vsigmas` is a `dict` which collects the estimated value sigma for heatmap/colorbar range determination. Items which only lists in the `vsigmas` will be plotted. You can adjust the `vsigmas` &  `title` to customize your own wafermap combination.

Below is a simple IncomingMap which contains two variables `MR` & `HDI` only.

E:\zwPython\py37\python-3.7.4.amd64\lib\site-packages\seaborn\matrix.py:70: DeprecationWarning: `np.bool` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `bool`. To silence this warning, use `bool` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.bool_` here.
Deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance: https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations
