DefectMap `defectmap`
=================================
> Wafer DefectMap with Pareto Subplot

DefectMap is aimed for defect analysis, beside the defect distribution by `cat_heatmap`, yield summary and top defect statistics are also applied by using inset pie chart and bar chart subplot.

Unlike in the `cat_heatmap`, categories are ordered by unique count in default. `defectmap` use the 'OK' as the top category and set it with `lightgreen` color. You can UAI other codes eg. 'BINA','BINB' as `OK` by update the `ok_codes`.

E:\zwPython\py37\python-3.7.4.amd64\lib\site-packages\seaborn\matrix.py:70: DeprecationWarning: `np.bool` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `bool`. To silence this warning, use `bool` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.bool_` here.
Deprecated in NumPy 1.20; for more details and guidance: https://numpy.org/devdocs/release/1.20.0-notes.html#deprecations

Above example used the default defect code from sample data, you change it to more reader-friendly and meaningful remark by modify the `code_dict` as below.
