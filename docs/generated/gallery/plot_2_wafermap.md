WaferMap `wafermap`
=================================
> WaferMap with Distribution & Median Trend Subplots

WaferMap add additional color distribution plot and trend charts by row/col around basic NumHeatmap.Color distribution plot shares the same limit as colorbar from heatmap. And vertical and horizonal trend charts is only diplayed when `wftype` is provided, since the grid line are using the pre-defined flash field boundary by `wftype`.
