WaferMap `wafermap`
=================================
> WaferMap with Distribution & Median Trend Subplots

WaferMap add additional color distribution plot and trend charts by row/col around basic NumHeatmap.Color distribution plot shares the same limit as colorbar from heatmap. And vertical and horizonal trend charts is only diplayed when `wftype` is provided, since the grid line are using the pre-defined flash field boundary by `wftype`.

E:\zwPython\py37\python-3.7.4.amd64\lib\site-packages\seaborn\matrix.py:70: DeprecationWarning: `np.bool` is a deprecated alias for the builtin `bool`. To silence this warning, use `bool` by itself. Doing this will not modify any behavior and is safe. If you specifically wanted the numpy scalar type, use `np.bool_` here.
